jQuery More
===========

This plugin truncates extended text and allows it to be shown dynamically.

* Change the truncation length.
* Expand only or expand/contract.
* Customise button expansion.

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/more.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/moreRef.html.
